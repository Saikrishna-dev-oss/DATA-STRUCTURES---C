# 🧠 Data Structures in C — Modular Weekly Repository

Welcome to my structured repository of core data structures implemented in C. This repo is designed for academic clarity, modular reuse, and collaborative learning — ideal for students, educators, and civic-tech builders.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder (`week1` to `week9`) contains focused modules covering specific data structures and their applications:

- **week1**: Polynomial Addition using Linked List
- **week2**: Circular Linked List
- **week3**: Doubly Linked List
- **week4**: Stack using Linked List
- **week4**: Queue using Linked List
- **week5**: Stack Applications (e.g., Expression Evaluation,Towers Of Hanoi)
- **week6**: Circular Queue using Arrays
- **week7**: Double-Ended Queue (Deque) using Linked List

  Starting Of Tree DataStructures

- **week8**: Binary Search Tree Full code, WRT Manual of My college,
-           *Tree Traversals (Iterative)
-           *Tree Traversals (Recursive)
- **week9**: Heap Sort, Merge Sort
- **Others**: Will Update Weekly

> 📌 Each module is self-contained, with clean code, comments, and scope for extension.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Structure**: Weekly modular breakdown for clarity and scalability

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo reflects my journey through foundational data structures, emphasizing:
- Modular engineering practices
- Reusable code patterns
- Peer learning and open-source contribution
- Civic-tech readiness for real-world applications

## 🤝 Contributions
